## Installation 💾

You can download JitHub from the Microsoft Store or build it from source.

### Microsoft Store

[Get JitHub from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/jithub/9MXRBJBB552V) and enjoy the best GitHub experience on Windows 😍.

### Build from source

To build JitHub from source, you need Visual Studio 2019 with the following workloads:

- Universal Windows Platform development 🖥️

JitHub is powered by the following NuGet packages:

- Microsoft.UI.Xaml 🎨
- Octokit 🐙
- Markdig 📑
- Html Agility Pack 🕸️
- Skiasharp ✏️
- Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp ⚙️

Then, you need to create a file named `appsettings.json` in the `JitHub` project folder with the following content. Go to [settings > Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create an OAuth app. Name it however you like, and in there you can get your clientID and secret. Copy them into the `appsettings.json` file. This file is gitignored, so please never commit it.
```json
{
  "Credential": {
    "ClientId": "<your client ID>",
    "ClientSecret": "<your client secret>"
  }
}
```

Now you need to download the built vs code files. Run `.\download-vscode.ps1` in PowerShell. This script will download the latest release of vs code from [jithub-vs-code](https://github.com/nerocui/jithub-vs-code) and unzip it to the `JitHub/Assets/dist` folder. No additional action needs to be performed.

After that, you can open the `JitHub.sln` file in Visual Studio and run the app.
