## Installation 💾

You can download JitHub from the Microsoft Store or build it from source.

### Microsoft Store

[Get JitHub from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/jithub/9MXRBJBB552V) and enjoy the best GitHub experience on Windows 😍.

### Build from source

To build JitHub from source, you need Visual Studio 2019 with the following workloads:

- Universal Windows Platform development 🖥️

JitHub is powered by the following NuGet packages:

- Microsoft.UI.Xaml 🎨
- Octokit 🐙
- Markdig 📑
- Html Agility Pack 🕸️
- Skiasharp ✏️
- Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp ⚙️

Then, you need to create a file named `appsettings.json` in the `JitHub` project folder with the following content. Go to [settings > Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create an OAuth app. Name it however you like, and in there you can get your clientID and secret. Copy them into the `appsettings.json` file. This file is gitignored, so please never commit it.
```json
{
  "Credential": {
    "ClientId": "<your client ID>"
  }
}
```

Finally, set environment variable `JithubAppSecret` to your GitHub seret and `JitHubClientId` to your GitHub client ID.

Now you need to build the editor assets from [jithub-vs-code](https://github.com/nerocui/jithub-vs-code). Run `.\sync-vscode-assets.ps1` in PowerShell. The script looks for a local `jithub-vs-code` clone (including `E:\jithub-vs-code`), runs `yarn --frozen-lockfile` and `yarn build`, and then copies the generated `dist` output into `JitHub\Assets\dist`.

After that, you can open the `JitHub.sln` file in Visual Studio and run the app.

### Microsoft Store release workflow

The repository now includes a manual GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/jithub-store-release.yml` for building a Store upload package and publishing it to Partner Center in one run.

JitHub is currently published from an **individual** Partner Center account. Full automation is still possible, but Microsoft Store publishing uses the same Microsoft Entra application flow that organization accounts use. That means the GitHub environment must contain the Partner Center product identity values **and** a working Entra tenant/app registration that has been granted access in Partner Center.

Set up a protected GitHub environment named `microsoft-store` and configure these secrets there:

- `STORE_PRODUCT_ID`
- `STORE_SELLER_ID`
- `STORE_TENANT_ID`
- `STORE_CLIENT_ID`
- `STORE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `STORE_PACKAGE_IDENTITY_NAME`
- `STORE_PACKAGE_PUBLISHER`

Optional secrets:

- `STORE_PHONE_PRODUCT_ID`
- `STORE_PHONE_PUBLISHER_ID`
- `STORE_PACKAGE_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`
- `STORE_PACKAGE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `STORE_PACKAGE_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT`

Optional environment variables:

- `STORE_APP_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `STORE_PUBLISHER_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `JITHUB_STORE_BUNDLE_PLATFORMS` (defaults to `x86|x64|arm64`)

Run the **Publish JitHub to Microsoft Store** workflow manually and provide a four-part `release_version` such as `1.6.5.0`. The workflow first checks out `nerocui/jithub-vs-code`, builds the editor assets into `JitHub\Assets\dist`, patches `JitHub\Package.appxmanifest` at runtime from the configured environment values, builds a Store upload package, uploads the build artifacts, and then publishes the generated `.appxupload` or `.msixupload` to the Microsoft Store.

The workflow accepts an `editor_assets_ref` input if you ever need to point it at a non-default `jithub-vs-code` ref for testing, but it now defaults to `master`.

If the publish step fails with Partner Center authorization errors, the remaining fix is not in GitHub Actions itself: the linked Microsoft Entra application still needs the correct Partner Center access for the individual developer account.
